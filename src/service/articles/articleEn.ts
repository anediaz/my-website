## The guide *Node.js Best Practices*

Many developers hold the *Node.js Best Practices* guide in high esteem, as it is one of the most important existing guides about Node.js. It is the largest compilation about this subject, and it is growing every week. Currently, more than 80 best practices, style guides, and architectural tips are presented. Each practice is completed with code examples, quotes from selected blogs, and more information.

The realization of this guide has been possible thanks to many collaborators, but, especially, its creators: [Yoni Goldberg](https://github.com/goldbergyoni), [Bruno Scheufler](https://github.com/BrunoScheufler), [Kyle Martin](https://github.com/js-kyle) and [Kevyn Bruyere](https://github.com/kevynb).

The guide *Node.js Best Practices* is already available [in Basque](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/blob/master/README.md). Originally published in English, nowadays it is available in other six languages: Brazilian Portugese, Chinese, Russian, Polish, Japanese and BASQUE! Other translations are in progress: French, Hebrew, Korean, Spanish and Turkish.

## Basque version’s adventure

“Our adventure began about a year ago, at the same time as the first pandemic (French) confinement provoked by the virus SARS-CoV-2.

This is when I noticed not only that many developers from all around the world proposed their help to translate this guide into other languages, but, above all, its existence. I found out it is one of the most important and reputed existing open-source guides about Node.js, available on [the net](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/blob/master/README.md).

I offered my help for the Basque translation, even if I wasn’t sure that the guide’s creators knew about the existence of the Basque language. Very soon, I received an email from Yoni Goldberg: he had heard about the Basque Country, he was amazed by our culture and landscapes, he had even the intention to come someday for a visit.

At first, I thought the translation would be easy: it’s been 10 years that I work as a web developer and I command perfectly the Basque language, in addition to being my mother tongue. I realized very soon that it would be longer and harder than I thought, as there exist a lot of anglicisms in the computing world, which are hard to translate into the Basque. Besides, in my everyday life, I am used to working in French and English, and often, my Basque phrases sound a bit artificial.

I thought about giving up. Fortunately, thanks to someone even more stubborn than me, I refer to my father, I changed my mind. He encouraged me to continue with it, and we have both worked on the translation for many months. We form a perfect team: combining his ability of writing in Basque and my developer knowledge, we have made it. After a year and several re-readings, corrections, doubts… we are proud of this publication. And happy to know that from now on, any Basque-speaker developer has the possibility of using such a high-level guide, in Basque!
